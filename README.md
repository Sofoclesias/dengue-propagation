# Spatial-Temporal Analysis of the Spread of Dengue in Lima and Callao, Peru: A Data Mining Study for Prevention Policies

Abstract—Multiple discussions support that atypical weather conditions and poor district sanitation management in Metropolitan Lima and El Callao, Peru, have led to an atypical increase in the number of dengue cases in 2024. Sanitation factors were identified as key determinants in the incidence of dengue cases. Using data mining techniques, correlations between variables such as exposure to landfills, water management and unstable infrastructure were determined. The results revealed district profiles with their own challenges in case incidence. Public policy interventions based on these findings are proposed to reduce the spread of dengue.

Index Terms—dengue, spatio-temporal analysis, Data Mining, agglomerative clustering, SHAP, Peru.
